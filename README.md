This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Wut is this?
An effort to make an interactive map of the stars using React, so eventually peasants can explore and know their way around the cosmos. Work in progress. Many thanks to [D3-celestial](https://github.com/ofrohn/d3-celestial) for the data provided.
